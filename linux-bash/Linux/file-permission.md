### Introduction - Why is file permission required?

In general, many people can connect to one Linux server and work on their own tasks or work together. If all user shares the same files and directories,  it's a potential risk of data loss or changes due to others' needs. Although the user may not have intended it, it can seriously interfere with their work by fixing or erasing files that are important to others, and in severe cases, it can move the location of some of the files needed by the system, preventing the system from locating them, causing the system to stop completely. Thus, our system needs a barrier system that blocks others from disturbing others' jobs. This is why file permission is required
